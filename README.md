# AlynaaStatus
A Discord bot which provides online/offline and player status for ThiccMC.

Currently being hosted on Replit.

## Depends
`discord.py`, `mc-status`, `decouple` and `maxembeds` (`maxembeds.py`)

## Commands
Go see them in the code :dream:. They start with the `.t` prefixes.

## How to use?
- Create a repl on Replit, put those files in.
- Create an environment variable, name it `TOKEN`, put your Discord bot token in the value box. Create another environment variable, name it `ADDRESS` and put your server's IP address in. (this script has a 2nd server monitorer for Thicc SMP SkyBlock, the address is stored in another environment variable called `SKYBLOCKADDRESS`. If you want to use this script just to monitor 1 server, comment/delete the code for the SkyBlock server.)
- Edit your bot's prefix and messages to your liking if you want in `main.py`.
- Start repl.

## 24/7 Hosting
- Login to your UptimeRobot account, create a monitor (HTTP(s) type) and put your repl's URL in.
